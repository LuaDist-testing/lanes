CHANGE X:

CHANGE 5 (new feature):
    Modifying Makefile so it's better suited to LuaRocks.


CHANGE 4 (new feature):
    Metatable copying, allowing Lua objects to be copied across lanes.


CHANGE 3 (bug fix) AKa 5-Aug-2008:
    The '__gc' method was not tied to thread userdata, at all. Caused memory
    lifespan problems at least on OS X when threads were cancelled (EINVAL).
    

CHANGE 2 (bug fix) AKa 5-Aug-2008:
    Better calculation of timeouts, always making them absolute (even in Win32)
    to allow for events that wake the lane up but don't read/write the Linda
    key that it was observing.


CHANGE 1 (bug fix) AKa 4-Aug-2008:
    Signalling woke up only one waiting thread, not all. This caused i.e. 
    receive to not wake up if there was another thread waiting on the same 
    Linda object.
    
    PThread fix: using 'pthread_cond_broadcast()' instead of 'pthread_cond_signal()'
    Win32 fix: using manual events and 'PulseEvent()'

(end)
